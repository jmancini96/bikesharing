### Summary
With a population ~40x smaller than New York City and a significantly smaller tourism sector, a similar business in Des Moines would likely see lower margins due to the necessary operating costs that would exist regardless of a consumer base. Some visualizations that would provide some better insight would include a breakdown of trips by user type: resident or tourist. Determining the primary use case of the bikes would help in determining the transferability of the NYC business model to a smaller city with less through-traffic. Another visualization that may be useful is a representation of the distance traveled by each bike. We have the time each bike is checked out, but the time the bike spends checked out only accurately impacts gross profit, not the cost of maintenance. A better method of determining rough maintenance costs per trip would be to determine the actual distance traveled.
